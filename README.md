## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- [.NET 5.0](https://get.dot.net)

### Source code

Get a clone of this repository

`git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/it.bz.noi.community-api`

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are needed in ordert to get the lambda function to work:

| Key           | Value                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| CLIENT_ID     | <CLIENT_ID provided by W端rth Phoenix>           |
| CLIENT_SECRET | <CLIENT_SECRET provided by W端rth Phoenix>       |
| TENANT_ID     | <TENANT_ID provided by W端rth Phoenix>           |
| SERVICE_URL   | https://noitest.crm4.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2 |
| SERVICE_SCOPE | https://noitest.crm4.dynamics.com/.default      |

***Question**: The SERVICE_URL and SERVICE_SCOPE (...noitest...) will change in the future?*

The following AWS command [configures the environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-api) for an AWS Lambda function:

```sh
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function \
    --environment "Variables={BUCKET=my-bucket,KEY=file.txt}"
```

## Development

The project can be developed purely with a basic editor in combination with the dotnet CLI.

### From the command line

Notable commands are:

- `dotnet tool restore`:
  restores the CLI tools
- `dotnet restore`:
  restores the project dependencies
- `dotnet build`:
  run a build
- `dotnet test`:
  run the tests
- `dotnet watch test -p ./test/it.bz.noi.community-api.Tests/`:
  watch and run tests after a file gets modified

### With an IDE

You can develop the app with your coding editor of your choice that supports C#. For example to code with Visual Studio Code:

- Start VS Code, e.g. by launching `code .` from the command line.
- Install the `ms-dotnettools.csharp` VS Code extension for C# coding support (if not already installed).
- The editor tooling should now work and you can start to code.

### Local testing

As the AWS documentation states the best way to test the functionality of the app is by writing unit tests then run `dotnet test` (https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/developer/net-5-aws-lambda-support-with-container-images/).

I am not convinced that this is a time efficient way to develop and test the functionality so I will try to get it to work via docker-compose and an iterative development approach. Documentation will follow.

## Deployment

The following Documentation describes the deployment process of a .NET application to AWS Lambda: https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/developer/deploying-net-core-aws-lambda-functions-from-the-command-line/

To deploy the image from your own machine make sure to configure an [AWS named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).

Then run the following commands:

```sh
dotnet tool restore
```

This restores the lambda command line tool needed for deployment.

Then run the lambda serverless deployment tool:

```sh
dotnet lambda deploy-serverless it-bz-noi-community--api -sb it-bz-noi-community--api -pl ./src/it.bz.noi.community-api/
```
